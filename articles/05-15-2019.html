                        <p><span style="font-size: 70px;">y</span>ou may think that being a web developer is an easy path for success, but you're wrong. i'm still learning since my departure from the ground, and i'm still there, but i'm willing to progress, to grow like a flower, like just everyone else. it'll take a lot of years for being considered as a master at coding, or even on an specific language. yeah yeah, don't worry, i know what you were wondering about: genius people. yes, genius people, geniuses are everywhere, but let's say that everybody can't be or isn't a genius. in fact, i'm not an actual genius, but maybe, maybe you are genius at coding, or as everybody would give you a very common concept: talent. yes, having talent could determine few points (- or +) about your final result, and sadly, this result will come to us when we give up forever, or just like a normal person: <b> natural death.</b> i don't want to fade away your willing about getting into the deepest of web development, but i suggest you to focus on coding and learning altogether, and you may succeed today, tomorrow ... nobody knows, just <span style="background: black; color: #00ff00; font-weight: 900; padding: 2px;">CODE</span>, like me. happy learning to myself, and the same for you, my friend!</p>
